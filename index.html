  Introduction
</header>
<p>Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh)[5] is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template (MVT) architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p>
<p>
Some well-known sites that use Django include the Public Broadcasting Service,Instagram,Mozilla,The Washington Times, Disqus,Bitbucket, and Nextdoor. It was used on Pinterest,but later the site moved to a framework built over Flask.</p>

Why django
</header>
  <p>With Django, you can take Web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours. Django takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ridiculously fast</li>
    <li>Fully loaded</li>
    <li>Reassuringly secure</li>
    <li>Exceedingly scalable</li>
    <li>Incredibly versatile</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common Web development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords</p>
<p>Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands</p>
<p>All it takes</p>
  <code>$pip install django</code>

Installation
</header>
  <p>Install pip. The easiest is to use the standalone pip installer. If your distribution already has pip installed, you might need to update it if it’s outdated. If it’s outdated, you’ll know because installation won’t work.
</p>
  <p>Take a look at virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. These tools provide isolated Python environments, which are more practical than installing packages systemwide. They also allow installing packages without administrator privileges.</p>
<code>$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv</code>
  <p>After you’ve created and activated a virtual environment, enter the command <code>pip install Django</code> at the shell prompt.</p>
